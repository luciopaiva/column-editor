Simple tool for pasting in column mode. Place the caret at the desired position and paste some multi-line text from your clipboard. It will seamlessly merge with the existing lines, aligning the new input with the current column the caret is at.

## To do

- undo/redo mechanism
- option to select whether pasted content should displace original content (current behavior) or replace it
